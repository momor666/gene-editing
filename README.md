Programs for simulation of gene editing applied to a dairy cattle population
============================================================================

This is a set of programs for simulating responses to selection in dairy cattle
populatons that make use of gene editing tools, such as TALENs and CRISPRs. They
are forked from my programs on managing multiple recessives
